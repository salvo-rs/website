# Quick Start

## Install Rust
If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can install it using the officially provided `rustup`.

:::tip
The minimum supported Rust version for Salvo is currently 1.85. Run `rustup update` to ensure you have a compatible Rust version installed.

## Writing Your First Salvo Program

Create a new project:

```bash
cargo new hello --bin
```

Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:

<CargoCode/>

In `main.rs`, create a simple function handler named `hello`. This function simply renders the text `"Hello world"`.

<HelloCode/>

Congratulations, your first Salvo program is complete. Just run `cargo run` in your terminal, then open `http://127.0.0.1:5800` in your browser.

## Detailed Explanation

Here, `hello_world` is a `Handler` used to process user requests. The `#[handler]` macro allows a function to easily implement the `Handler` trait. Furthermore, it allows us to abbreviate the function parameters in different ways.

- Original form:

    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(_req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, _ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
        res.render("Hello world");
    }
    ```

- You can omit parameters that are not used in the function, like `_req`, `_depot`, and `_ctrl` here, which can be simply left out:

    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(res: &mut Response) {
        res.render("Hello world");
    }
    ```

- Any type can be used as the return type of the function, as long as it implements the `Writer` trait. For example, `&str` implements `Writer`. When used as a return value, it renders plain text:

    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(res: &mut Response) -> &'static str {
        "Hello world"
    }
    ```

- More commonly, we need to use `Result<T, E>` as the return type to handle errors during function execution. If both `T` and `E` implement `Writer`, then `Result<T, E>` can be used as the return value:
  
    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(res: &mut Response) -> Result<&'static str, ()> {
        Ok("Hello world")
    }
    ```

## Awesome HTTP3

HTTP3 is renowned for its speed and efficiency, a feature many developers have eagerly anticipated. Now, Salvo makes it easy to harness the power of HTTP3 and enjoy its benefits!

First, enable the HTTP3 feature in `Cargo.toml`, then modify `main.rs` like this:
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
  <HelloH3Code/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
  <HelloH3CargoCode/>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Salvo CLI Tool üõ†Ô∏è

[Salvo CLI](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-cli) is a tool designed for the Salvo web framework. It helps create clean, readable code, saving you time for more interesting things in life.

If you have ideas for improving the CLI or find any issues that need fixing, please don't hesitate! Submit an issue; we welcome your insights.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1

  Install the CLI tool:
  
  ```bash
  cargo install salvo-cli
  ```

  ### Step 2

  > Create a new Salvo project using the `new` command followed by your project name:
  >
  > ```bash
  > salvo new project_name
  > ```
</Steps>

You can quickly start your Salvo project with this simple CLI tool, allowing you to focus on implementing your business logic instead of setting up the project structure. ‚ú®

## More Examples

It's recommended to clone the Salvo repository directly and run the examples in the `examples` directory. For instance, the following command runs the `hello` example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo
cd salvo/examples
cargo run --bin example-hello
```

There are many examples in the `examples` directory. You can run them using commands like `cargo run --bin example-<name>`.
