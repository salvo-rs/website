# Quick Start

## Installing Rust

If you donâ€™t have Rust yet, we recommend you use `rustup` to manage your Rust installation. The [official rust guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) has a wonderful section on getting started.

Salvo currently has a minimum supported Rust version 1.75. Running `rustup update` will ensure you have the latest and greatest Rust version available. As such, this guide assumes you are running Rust 1.75 or later.

## Write first app

Create a new rust project:

```bash
cargo new hello_salvo --bin
```

Add this to `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[package]
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[dependencies]
salvo = "0.64.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros"] }
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
```

Create a simple function handler in the main.rs file, we call it `hello`, this function just render plain text `"Hello world"`. In the `main` function, we need to create a root Router first, and then create a server and call it's `bind` function:

@[code rust](../../codes/hello/src/main.rs)

Congratulations! Your first app has done! Just run `cargo run` to run this app.

## More about handler

There are many ways to write function handler.

- The orginal format is:

    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(_req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, _ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
        res.render("Hello world");
    }
    ```

- You can omit function arguments if they are not used, like ```_req```, ```_depot```, ```_ctrl``` in this example:

    ``` rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(res: &mut Response) {
        res.render("Hello world");
    }
    ```

- Any type can be function handler's return value if it implements `Writer`. For example ```&str``` implements `Writer` and it will render string as plain text:

    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(res: &mut Response) -> &'static str {// just return &str
        "Hello world"
    }
    ```

- The more common situation is we want to return a ```Result<T, E>``` to implify error handling. If ```T``` and ```E``` implements `Writer`, ```Result<T, E>``` can be function handler's return type:

    ```rust
    #[handler]
    async fn hello(res: &mut Response) -> Result<&'static str, ()> {// return Result
        Ok("Hello world")
    }
    ```

## Use HTTP3

First you need to enable feature `http3` in `Cargo.toml`, and then change `main.rs` like this:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="main.rs" active>

@[code rust](../../codes/hello-h3/src/main.rs)

  </CodeGroupItem>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Cargo.toml">

@[code toml](../../codes/hello-h3/Cargo.toml)

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

## Run more examples

The absolute fastest way to start experimenting with Salvo is to clone the
Salvo repository and run the included examples in the `examples/` directory.
For instance, the following set of commands runs the `hello` example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo.git
cd salvo
cargo run --bin example-hello
```

There are numerous examples in the `examples/` directory. They can all be run
with `cargo run --bin example-<name>`.
