# Graceful Shutdown

Graceful shutdown refers to the process where, when a server is being shut down, it does not immediately terminate all connections. Instead, it first stops accepting new requests while allowing existing requests sufficient time to complete their processing before closing the service. This approach prevents requests from being abruptly interrupted, thereby improving user experience and system reliability.

Salvo provides support for graceful shutdown through the `handle` method of the `Server`, which retrieves the server handle, followed by calling the `stop_graceful` method to implement the shutdown. After invoking this method, the server will:

- Stop accepting new connection requests
- Wait for existing requests to complete processing
- Forcefully close any remaining connections after a specified timeout (if provided)

Here is a simple example:

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<Tabs>
<Tab label="main.rs">
```rust file="<root>/codes/graceful-shutdown/src/main.rs"
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="Cargo.toml">
```toml file="<root>/codes/graceful-shutdown/Cargo.toml"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

In the example above:

- `server.handle()` retrieves the server handle, which can be used to control the server's lifecycle
- `handle.stop_graceful(None)` initiates the graceful shutdown process, where `None` indicates no timeout is set, meaning the server will wait indefinitely for all requests to complete
- To set a timeout, you can pass `Some(Duration)`, after which any remaining connections will be forcefully closed

This approach is particularly suitable for applications deployed in container environments or on cloud platforms, as well as for scenarios requiring hot updates to ensure that requests are not unexpectedly interrupted.
