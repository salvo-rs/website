# Writer

`Writer` is used to write content to `Response`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Writer {
    async fn write(mut self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response);
}
```

Compared to `Handler`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Handler: Send + Sync + 'static {
    async fn handle(&self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl);
}
```

Their differences are:

- Different uses, `Writer` represents writing specific content to `Response`, which is implemented by specific content, such as strings, error messages, etc. `Handler` is used to process the entire request .
- `Writer` is created in `Handler`, it will consume itself when the `write` function is called, it is a one-time call. And `Handler` is common to all requests;
- `Writer` can be used as the content of `Result` returned by `Handler`;
- The `FlowCtrl` parameter does not exist in `Writer`, and cannot control the execution flow of the entire request.

`Scribe` implements `Writer`, but with less functionality than `Writer`:

```rust
pub trait Scribe {
    fn render(self, res: &mut Response);
}
```

`Scribe`'s rendering function just writes data to `Response`, this process cannot get information from `Request` or `Depot`.
