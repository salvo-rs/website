# Response Compression

A middleware for compressing the content of `Response`.

Supports three compression formats: `br`, `gzip`, and `deflate`. The priority and configuration of each compression method can be customized as needed.

## Data Compression in HTTP Protocol

1. File format level: Specific file types use dedicated compression algorithms.
2. HTTP protocol level: End-to-end resource compression transmission is achieved through content encoding.
3. Connection level: Data compression is performed between nodes of an HTTP connection.

For more information about HTTP compression, refer to the [Mozilla Developer Network documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Compression).
