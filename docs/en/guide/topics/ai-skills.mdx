# AI Skills

[Salvo Skills](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-skills) is a collection of 27 specialized AI agent skills designed for the Salvo web framework. These skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agent-skills.github.io/) open standard and help AI assistants understand and generate Salvo code more effectively.

## What Are AI Skills?

AI Skills are structured knowledge modules that provide AI coding assistants with deep, framework-specific expertise. When integrated into your development environment, they enable AI tools to:

- Generate accurate, idiomatic Salvo code
- Understand Salvo's architecture and conventions (e.g., `#[handler]` macro, Router, Depot)
- Provide contextual guidance on topics like routing, middleware, authentication, WebSocket, and more

## Setup Guide

### Claude Code

Copy the skills into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-skills.git
cp -r salvo-skills/skills .claude/skills/
```

Skills load automatically when Claude Code works with your Salvo project.

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

1. Copy the skills into `.github/skills/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-skills.git
cp -r salvo-skills/skills .github/skills/
```

2. Enable agent skills in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "chat.useAgentSkills": true
}
```

Skills activate automatically when you discuss Salvo topics with Copilot.

### Cursor

Add skills as documentation context in Cursor:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-skills.git
```

2. Create or edit the `.cursor/rules` file in your project root and add:

```
Read and follow the skill files in .cursor/skills/ directory for Salvo framework guidance.
```

3. Copy the skills:

```bash
cp -r salvo-skills/skills .cursor/skills/
```

Cursor will reference these skill files when generating Salvo-related code.

### Windsurf

Configure skills as knowledge context in Windsurf:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-skills.git
```

2. Create or edit the `.windsurfrules` file in your project root and add:

```
Read and follow the skill files in .windsurf/skills/ directory for Salvo framework guidance.
```

3. Copy the skills:

```bash
cp -r salvo-skills/skills .windsurf/skills/
```

### Other AI Tools

For any AI coding assistant that supports custom instructions or context files, you can:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-skills.git`
2. Place the `skills/` folder in your project directory
3. Configure your AI tool to reference these files as context
