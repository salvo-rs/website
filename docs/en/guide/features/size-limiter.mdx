# File Upload Size Limiter Middleware

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

A middleware for limiting the size of uploaded files in requests.

## Use Cases

Size Limiter is primarily used in the following scenarios:
- Preventing users from uploading excessively large files that consume server resources
- Avoiding server memory overflow caused by malicious attackers uploading massive amounts of data
- Setting different request size limit policies for different API endpoints
- Improving server request processing efficiency and stability
