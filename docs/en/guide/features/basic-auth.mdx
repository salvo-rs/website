A middleware that provides support for Basic Auth.

## Introduction to Basic Auth

Basic Auth is a simple HTTP authentication mechanism that transmits a username and password via the `Authorization` header in HTTP requests. The format is `Authorization: Basic <base64 username:password>`. While simple, since credentials are only Base64-encoded rather than encrypted, it is typically used with HTTPS to ensure security.

## Comparison of Basic Auth Implementations in Common Frameworks

| Framework | Language | Basic Auth Implementation |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| Salvo | Rust | Implemented via the `BasicAuth` middleware and custom `BasicAuthValidator` |
| Express | JavaScript | Uses the `express-basic-auth` middleware package |
| Spring Security | Java | Configured via `httpBasic()` and implemented with `UserDetailsService` |
| ASP.NET Core | C# | Uses `.UseAuthentication()` and `AddAuthentication(AuthenticationSchemes.Basic)` |
| Gin | Go | Implemented via custom middleware or using the `gin-contrib/auth` package |

## Use Cases

Basic Auth is suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Internal APIs and Tools**: Management tools and APIs used within a company
2. **Development and Testing Environments**: Quickly implement authentication without a complex login system
3. **Simple API Protection**: When a complex user management system is not required
4. **Combined with Other Security Measures**: As part of a multi-layered security architecture

In Salvo, the Basic Auth middleware can be easily integrated into routes. By implementing the `BasicAuthValidator` trait, custom validation logic can be defined, offering great flexibility.

## Considerations

- Always use with HTTPS to protect credential transmission
- Not suitable for production environments storing sensitive information
- Consider using more secure authentication methods such as JWT or OAuth for production environments
