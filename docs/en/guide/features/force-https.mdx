# Force HTTPS

The `force-https` middleware can redirect all requests to use the HTTPS protocol.

If this middleware is applied to a `Router`, it will only enforce protocol redirection when a route is matched. If a page does not exist, no redirection will occur.

However, a more common requirement is to automatically redirect any request, even when the route fails to match and returns a `404` error. In such cases, the middleware can be added to the `Service`. Middleware added to the `Service` will always execute, regardless of whether the request is successfully matched by a route.

_**Example Code**_ 

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
  ```rust file="<root>/codes/force-https/src/main.rs"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
  ```toml file="<root>/codes/force-https/Cargo.toml"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
