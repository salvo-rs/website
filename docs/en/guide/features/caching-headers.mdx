# Caching Headers

A middleware that provides support for configuring caching headers.

Cache control is a crucial part of web performance optimization. By correctly setting caching headers, unnecessary network requests can be reduced, thereby improving application performance. [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) is an HTTP response header used to specify browser caching policies. It controls who can cache responses, under what conditions, and for how long.

Internally, it includes implementations of three `Handler`s: `CachingHeaders`, `Modified`, and `ETag`. `CachingHeaders` is a combination of the latter two. Under normal circumstances, `CachingHeaders` is used.

- `Modified`: Provides cache validation based on the resource's last modified time.
- `ETag`: Uses Entity Tags to offer a more precise resource validation mechanism.
- `CachingHeaders`: Combines the above two mechanisms to provide comprehensive cache control support.
