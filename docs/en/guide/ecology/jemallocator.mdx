:::tip  
The default allocator may sometimes fail to release memory promptly. It is recommended to use jemallocator instead.  
:::  

jemallocator is a library linked with the jemalloc memory allocator, providing the `Jemalloc` unit type that implements the allocator API and can be set as `#[global_allocator]`.  

`tikv-jemallocator` is the successor to `jemallocator`. These two crates are identical except for their names. For new projects, it is recommended to use the `tikv-xxx` version.  

## The jemalloc Ecosystem  

The jemalloc support ecosystem consists of the following crates:  

- **tikv-jemalloc-sys**: Builds and links to jemalloc, exposing raw C bindings to it.  
- **tikv-jemallocator**: Provides the `Jemalloc` type, which implements the `GlobalAlloc` and `Alloc` traits.  
- **tikv-jemalloc-ctl**: A high-level wrapper for jemalloc's control and introspection APIs (the `mallctl*()` function family and `MALLCTL NAMESPACE`).  

## Usage  

### Adding Dependencies  

To use tikv-jemallocator, add it as a dependency:  

```toml  
[dependencies]  

[target.'cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))'.dependencies]  
tikv-jemallocator = "0.5"  
```  

### Setting as the Global Allocator  

To set `tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc` as the global allocator, add the following code to your project:  

```rust  
#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]  
use tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc;  

#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]  
#[global_allocator]  
static GLOBAL: Jemalloc = Jemalloc;  
```  

That's it! Once this static variable is defined, jemalloc will be used for all memory allocations requested by Rust code in the same program.  

## Advantages  

jemalloc is a general-purpose malloc implementation that focuses on:  

- Reducing memory fragmentation  
- Scalability in high-concurrency scenarios  
- Providing rich introspection and control capabilities  

It is particularly useful in the following scenarios:  
- Long-running applications  
- Memory-intensive workloads  
- High-performance services requiring fine-grained memory management  

## Compatibility Notes  

jemalloc does not support the MSVC target environment and is therefore unavailable when using the MSVC toolchain on Windows. This is why the `cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))` condition is included in the example code.
