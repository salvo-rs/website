# Writer

`Writer` is used to write content to the `Response`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Writer {
    async fn write(mut self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response);
}
```

Compared to `Handler`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Handler: Send + Sync + 'static {
    async fn handle(&self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl);
}
```

The direct differences between them are:
- Different purposes: `Writer` represents writing specific content to the `Response` and is implemented by the specific content (e.g., strings, error messages, etc.). In contrast, `Handler` is used to process the entire request.
- `Writer` is created within a `Handler` and consumes itself when its `write` function is called, making it a one-time use. In contrast, `Handler` is shared across all requests.
- A `Writer` can be the content within the `Result` returned by a `Handler`.
- `Writer` does not have a `FlowCtrl` parameter and cannot control the execution flow of the entire request.

`Scribe` implements `Writer`, but it offers fewer functionalities than `Writer`:

```rust
pub trait Scribe {
    fn render(self, res: &mut Response);
}
```

The rendering function of `Scribe` only writes data to the `Response`; this process cannot access information from the `Request` or `Depot`.
