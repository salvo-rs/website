# WebSocket

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

A middleware that provides support for `WebSocket`.

## Introduction to WebSocket

WebSocket is a protocol that enables full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. It simplifies data exchange between clients and servers by allowing the server to actively push data to the client. In the WebSocket protocol, the browser and server only need to perform a handshake once to establish a persistent connection and enable bidirectional data transmission.

Unlike traditional HTTP requests, a WebSocket connection remains open after being established, avoiding frequent connection setup and teardown, which significantly reduces communication overhead. This makes WebSocket particularly suitable for real-time applications, such as online games, chat applications, stock tickers, and other applications that require real-time updates.

Salvo provides a concise and powerful API through its WebSocket middleware, enabling developers to easily integrate WebSocket functionality into their applications.
