# Jemallocator: Rust jemalloc Memory Allocator Alternative

:::tip
The default allocator may sometimes fail to release memory promptly. It is recommended to use [jemallocator](https://docs.rs/tikv-jemallocator/latest/tikv_jemallocator/) as a global allocator to replace the default one.
:::

[jemallocator](https://docs.rs/tikv-jemallocator/latest/tikv_jemallocator/) is a library linked with the jemalloc memory allocator, providing the `Jemalloc` unit type that implements the allocator API and can be set as `#[global_allocator]`.

`tikv-jemallocator` is the successor project to `jemallocator`. These two crates are identical except for their names. For new projects, it is recommended to use the `tikv-xxx` version.

## jemalloc Ecosystem

The jemalloc support ecosystem consists of the following crates:

- **tikv-jemalloc-sys**: Builds and links to jemalloc, exposing raw C bindings to it.
- **tikv-jemallocator**: Provides the `Jemalloc` type that implements the `GlobalAlloc` and `Alloc` traits.
- **tikv-jemalloc-ctl**: High-level wrappers for jemalloc control and introspection APIs (the `mallctl*()` function family and `MALLCTL NAMESPACE`).

## Usage

### Adding Dependencies

To use tikv-jemallocator, add it as a dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]

[target.'cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))'.dependencies]
tikv-jemallocator = "0.5"
```

### Setting as Global Allocator

To set `tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc` as the global allocator, add the following code to your project:

```rust
#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]
use tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc;

#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: Jemalloc = Jemalloc;
```

That's it! Once this static variable is defined, jemalloc will be used for all memory allocations requested by Rust code within the same program.

## Advantages

jemalloc is a general-purpose malloc implementation focusing on:

- Reducing memory fragmentation
- Scalability in high-concurrency scenarios
- Providing rich introspection and control capabilities

It is particularly useful in the following scenarios:
- Long-running applications
- Memory-intensive workloads
- High-performance services requiring fine-grained memory management

## Compatibility Notes

jemalloc does not support the MSVC target environment and is therefore unavailable when using the MSVC toolchain on Windows. This is why the `cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))` condition is included in the example code.
