# Logging Middleware

Logging plays a crucial role in web applications, enabling:
- Detailed information about request processing, helping developers track application behavior
- Assistance with troubleshooting and debugging, especially in production environments
- Monitoring of application performance and resource usage
- Recording of user access patterns and system exceptions
- Meeting security audit and compliance requirements

Salvo provides middleware with basic logging functionality. If the middleware is added directly to a `Router`, it won't be able to capture 404 errors returned when no `Router` matches. It's recommended to add it to the `Service` instead.

_**Example Code**_

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'rspress/theme';
import LoggingCode from '../../../../codes_md/logging/src/main.mdx';
import LoggingCargoCode from '../../../../codes_md/logging/Cargo.mdx';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
    <LoggingCode/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
    <LoggingCargoCode/>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
