# OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized approach to collecting and exporting telemetry data from applications, including traces, metrics, and logs. It helps developers monitor application performance, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of distributed systems.

Key Advantages of OpenTelemetry:
- Unified APIs and tools with no vendor lock-in
- Support for multiple programming languages and backend systems
- Low-overhead data collection
- Robust support for distributed tracing

Provides middleware with OpenTelemetry support. You can refer to the [example](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/tree/main/examples/otel-jaeger) in the official repository.
