# Ecosystem

Salvo boasts a rich ecosystem, including community-maintained modules, projects built on Salvo, and a wealth of tutorial resources. These resources can help you better utilize the Salvo framework to build high-performance web applications.

Additionally, this subdirectory shares some libraries that work well with Salvo. The Rust language is rapidly evolving, and its ecosystem is characterized by numerous small, focused libraries. We hope these commonly used libraries can help you quickly get started with the Rust ecosystem, becoming like a pocketful of handy tools from Doraemon.
