# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

## What is SSE

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology that allows servers to push data to clients. Unlike WebSocket, SSE is a one-way communication method, where data can only be sent from the server to the client. It is suitable for scenarios where the server needs to push data in real-time, but the client does not need to send data frequently. SSE is based on the HTTP protocol, easy to implement, and comes with built-in reconnection mechanisms.

Provides middleware support for `SSE`.

_**Example Code**_ 

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
  ```rust file="<root>/codes/sse/src/main.rs"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
  ```toml file="<root>/codes/sse/Cargo.toml"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Chat Application Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
  ```rust file="<root>/codes/sse-chat/src/main.rs"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
  ```toml file="<root>/codes/sse-chat/Cargo.toml"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integration with Large Language Models

When integrating AI using OpenAI SDK or other large language model SDKs, streaming responses (Stream) are a common requirement. SSE provides a perfect solution, enabling real-time delivery of AI-generated content to the frontend, thereby offering a better user experience.

For example, when using OpenAI's Chat Completion API with streaming responses, Salvo's SSE functionality can be leveraged to send AI-generated content incrementally to the client, eliminating the delay of waiting for a complete response.
