# Writer

`Writer` is used to write content into `Response`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Writer {
    async fn write(mut self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response);
}
```

Compared to Handler:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Handler: Send + Sync + 'static {
    async fn handle(&self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl);
}
```

The main differences between them are:
- Different purposes: `Writer` represents writing specific content into `Response`, implemented by concrete content such as strings, error messages, etc. In contrast, `Handler` is used to process the entire request.
- `Writer` is created within a `Handler` and consumes itself when the `write` function is called, making it a one-time call. On the other hand, `Handler` is shared across all requests.
- `Writer` can be returned as the content in the `Result` of a `Handler`.
- `Writer` does not include a `FlowCtrl` parameter, so it cannot control the execution flow of the entire request.

`Scribe` implements `Writer` but offers fewer capabilities compared to `Writer`:

```rust
pub trait Scribe {
    fn render(self, res: &mut Response);
}
```

The rendering function of `Scribe` only writes data into `Response` and cannot retrieve information from `Request` or `Depot` during this process.
