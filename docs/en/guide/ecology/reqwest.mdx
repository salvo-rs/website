Reqwest is a high-level HTTP client library that simplifies HTTP request handling with many built-in features:

- Supports both async and blocking APIs
- Handles various request body types: plain text, JSON, URL-encoded forms, multipart forms
- Customizable redirect policies
- HTTP proxy support
- TLS encryption by default
- Cookie management

## Basic Usage

### Making GET Requests

For single requests, use the `get` convenience method:

```rust
let body = reqwest::get("https://www.rust-lang.org")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await?;

println!("body = {body:?}");
```

> Note: When making multiple requests, it's better to create and reuse a `Client` to benefit from connection pooling.

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.get("https://www.rust-lang.org")
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### Making POST Requests

Set request bodies using the `body()` method:

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .body("the exact body that is sent")
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### Form Data

Sending form data is common—any type that can be serialized into form data will work:

```rust
// This will POST a body of `foo=bar&baz=quux`
let params = [("foo", "bar"), ("baz", "quux")];
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .form(&params)
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### JSON Data

Easily send JSON data with the `json` method (requires `json` feature):

```rust
// This will POST a body of `{"lang":"rust","body":"json"}`
let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert("lang", "rust");
map.insert("body", "json");

let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .json(&map)
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### Response Handling

Responses can be processed in multiple ways:

```rust
let res = client.get("https://www.rust-lang.org").send().await?;

// Get status code
let status = res.status();

// Get response headers
let content_type = res.headers().get("content-type").unwrap();

// Read response body as text
let body = res.text().await?;

// Or parse as JSON
let json: serde_json::Value = res.json().await?;
```

## Advanced Features

### Redirect Policies

By default, the client automatically handles HTTP redirects with up to 10 hops. Customize this behavior using `ClientBuilder`:

```rust
let custom_client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .redirect(reqwest::redirect::Policy::none()) // Disable redirects
    .build()?;
```

### Cookie Support

Enable automatic storage and sending of session cookies via `ClientBuilder`:

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .cookie_store(true)
    .build()?;
```

### Proxy Configuration

System proxies are enabled by default, reading from environment variables:

- `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy`: Proxy for HTTP connections
- `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy`: Proxy for HTTPS connections
- `ALL_PROXY` or `all_proxy`: Proxy for both types of connections

Proxies can also be explicitly set:

```rust
let proxy = reqwest::Proxy::http("https://secure.example")?;
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .proxy(proxy)
    .build()?;

// Or disable proxies
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .no_proxy()
    .build()?;
```

### TLS Configuration

The client uses TLS by default for HTTPS connections:

```rust
// Add custom root certificates
let cert = reqwest::Certificate::from_pem(&cert_bytes)?;
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .add_root_certificate(cert)
    .build()?;

// Configure client certificates
let identity = reqwest::Identity::from_pkcs12_der(&pkcs12_der, "password")?;
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .identity(identity)
    .build()?;
```

### Timeout Settings

Configure request timeouts:

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .timeout(std::time::Duration::from_secs(10))
    .build()?;
```

## Optional Features

Reqwest offers multiple optional features that can be enabled via Cargo:

- `http2` (enabled by default): HTTP/2 support
- `default-tls` (enabled by default): TLS support for HTTPS
- `rustls-tls`: TLS functionality via rustls
- `blocking`: Blocking client API
- `json`: JSON serialization/deserialization
- `multipart`: Multipart form support
- `cookies`: Cookie session support
- `gzip`, `brotli`, `deflate`, `zstd`: Response body decompression
- `socks`: SOCKS5 proxy support

## Blocking API

When async isn't needed, use the blocking API (requires `blocking` feature):

```rust
let body = reqwest::blocking::get("https://www.rust-lang.org")?.text()?;

let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .json(&map)
    .send()?;
```
