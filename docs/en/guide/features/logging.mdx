# Logging Middleware

Logging plays a crucial role in web applications, as it enables:
- Providing detailed information about the request handling process to help developers track application behavior
- Assisting in troubleshooting and debugging, especially in production environments
- Monitoring application performance and resource usage
- Recording user access patterns and system exceptions
- Meeting security auditing and compliance requirements

Salvo provides a middleware with basic logging functionality. If the middleware is added directly to a `Router`, it will not capture 404 errors returned when no `Router` matches the request. It is recommended to add it to the `Service` instead.

_**Example Code**_ 

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
  ```rust file="<root>/codes/logging/src/main.rs"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
  ```toml file="<root>/codes/logging/Cargo.toml"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
