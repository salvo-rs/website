# JWT Authentication

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) used for securely transmitting information between parties. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims in JSON object format, typically used for authentication and information exchange.

A JWT consists of three parts:
- **Header** - Specifies the token type and the signing algorithm used
- **Payload** - Contains claims such as user ID, roles, expiration time, etc.
- **Signature** - Used to verify that the message hasn't been altered during transmission

Typical usage of JWT in authentication flow:
1. After user login, the server generates a JWT token
2. The token is returned to the client and stored (usually in localStorage or cookies)
3. In subsequent requests, the client includes this token in the Authorization header
4. The server verifies the token's validity and authorizes access

Provides middleware for JWT Auth verification.

_**Example Code**_ 

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'rspress/theme';
import JwtAuthCode from '../../../../codes_md/jwt-auth/src/main.mdx';
import JwtAuthCargoCode from '../../../../codes_md/jwt-auth/Cargo.mdx';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
    <JwtAuthCode/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
    <JwtAuthCargoCode/>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
