# Force HTTPS

The `force-https` middleware can redirect all requests to use the HTTPS protocol.

If this middleware is applied to a `Router`, it will only enforce protocol redirection when the route is matched. If the page does not exist, no redirection will occur.

However, a more common requirement is to automatically redirect any request, even when the route fails to match and returns a `404` error. In such cases, the middleware can be added to the `Service`. Regardless of whether the request matches a route successfully, middleware added to the `Service` will always be executed.

_**Example Code**_  

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'rspress/theme';
import ForceHttpsCode from '../../../../codes_md/force-https/src/main.mdx';
import ForceHttpsCargoCode from '../../../../codes_md/force-https/Cargo.mdx';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
    <ForceHttpsCode/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
    <ForceHttpsCargoCode/>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
