# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server architecture that receives requests from clients and forwards them to one or more backend servers. Unlike a forward proxy (which acts on behalf of clients), a reverse proxy operates on behalf of the server side.

Key advantages of reverse proxies:
- Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple servers
- Enhanced Security: Hides real server information
- Content Caching: Improves performance
- Path Rewriting and Forwarding: Routes requests flexibly

The Salvo framework provides middleware for reverse proxy functionality.

_**Example Code**_ 

import { Tab, Tabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
  ```rust file="<root>/codes/proxy-simple/src/main.rs"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
  ```toml file="<root>/codes/proxy-simple/Cargo.toml"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
