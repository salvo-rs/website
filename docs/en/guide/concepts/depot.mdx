[Depot](https://docs.rs/salvo_core/latest/salvo_core/struct.Depot.html) is used to store temporary data involved in a single request. Middleware can place processed temporary data into the Depot for use by subsequent handlers.

When a server receives a request from a client browser, it creates a `Depot` instance. This instance is destroyed after all middleware and `Handler` have finished processing the request.

For example, we can set `current_user` in authentication middleware, then read the current user information in subsequent middleware or handlers.

## Quick Understanding

`Depot` is used for storing and sharing data during request processing. It implements a type-safe data container supporting two primary usage patterns:

1. **Key-Value Storage**: Access values associated with string keys via `insert`/`get` methods
2. **Type Injection**: Store and retrieve values based on type through `inject`/`obtain` methods

As shown in examples, `Depot` is particularly useful for passing data between middleware and handlers. Middleware can set values (like user info, authentication status) in `Depot`, which subsequent handlers can access without recomputation or repeated queries. `Depot`'s design ensures data consistency and accessibility throughout the request processing chain, making it a core tool for building complex web applications.

## Setting and Retrieving Data via `insert` and `get`

As shown above, you can insert key-value pairs into `Depot` using `insert`. For such values, simply use `get` to retrieve them.

```rust
depot.insert("a", "b");
assert_eq!(depot.get::<&str>("a").copied().unwrap(), "b")
```

Returns `None` if the key doesn't exist or if the type doesn't match the stored value.

## Setting and Retrieving Data via `inject` and `obtain`

For cases where values don't need specific keys and only one instance per type exists, you can use `inject` to insert data and `obtain` to retrieve it. These methods don't require keys.

```rust
depot.inject(Config::new());
depot.obtain::<Config>();
```
