# How to Deploy Applications

A Salvo project, after compilation, becomes an executable file. For deployment, you only need to upload this executable along with its dependent static resources to the server.

For Rust-based projects, there is also a very simple deployment platform: [shuttle.rs](https://www.shuttle.rs). Shuttle provides support for Salvo-like projects. For details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.shuttle.rs/guide/salvo-examples.html).

## Docker Deployment

You can also use Docker to deploy Salvo applications. Below is a basic `Dockerfile` example, which you can adjust according to your project's requirements:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM rust:slim AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files first to build dependencies (leveraging cache layers)
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
RUN mkdir src && \
    echo 'fn main() { println!("Placeholder"); }' > src/main.rs && \
    cargo build --release

# Copy actual source code and build the application
COPY src ./src/
RUN touch src/main.rs && \
    cargo build --release

# Use a lightweight base image for the runtime stage
FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a non-root user to run the application
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash appuser
USER appuser
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the binary file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/release/your_app_name ./app

# Set the container startup command
CMD ["./app"]
```

### Usage Instructions

1. Save the above `Dockerfile` in your project's root directory.
2. Adjust `your_app_name` to the actual binary file name according to your project.
3. If your application requires static files (such as templates, CSS, JS, etc.), you can add corresponding `COPY` commands.
4. If your application requires environment variable configuration, you can use the `ENV` instruction.
5. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   ```
6. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5800:5800 your-app-name
   ```

Please adjust the port number and other configurations according to your application's actual needs.
