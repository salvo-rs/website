Middleware for serving static files or embedded files. For detailed API, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_extra/latest/salvo_extra/request_id/index.html).

## Use Cases
Static file serving has wide applications in web development:
- Serving static assets for websites, such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
- Hosting Single Page Applications (SPAs).
- Distributing documents, media files, downloadable content, etc.
- Acting as a complete hosting solution for simple websites.

## Key Features

- `StaticDir` provides support for serving static files from local directories. You can pass a list of multiple directories as arguments. For example:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
<StaticDirListMainCode />
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
<StaticDirListCargoCode />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
  If a corresponding file is not found in the first directory, it will be searched for in the second directory.

`StaticDir` supports prioritizing sending pre-compressed files if they exist. For instance, if `index.html`, `index.html.gz`, `index.html.zst`, and `index.html.br` all exist, then `index.html.gz`, `index.html.zst`, and `index.html.br` are considered pre-compressed versions of `index.html`. The appropriate compressed file will be sent based on the request information (e.g., `Accept-Encoding` header).

- Provides support for `rust-embed`, for example:

## Pros and Cons of `rust-embed`

**Pros:**
- Embeds static files directly into the binary, simplifying the deployment process.
- Eliminates the need to manage static files separately in the production environment.
- Potentially offers better performance (memory access vs. disk I/O).
- More secure, as files cannot be accidentally modified.

**Cons:**
- Increases the size of the application binary.
- Updating static content requires recompiling and redeploying the entire application.
- Not suitable for large static assets that change frequently.

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
<StaticEmbedFilesMainCode />
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
<StaticEmbedFilesCargoCode />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can set a default page using `default`. The `with_fallback` and `fallback` options allow you to specify a file to serve when the requested file is not found. This is particularly useful for certain Single Page Applications (SPAs).
