# Trailing Slash

Middleware to automatically add or remove trailing slashes (`/`).

## Use Cases

The Trailing Slash middleware is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **URL Normalization**: Ensures all URLs adhere to a consistent format (either always adding or always removing the trailing slash), which helps improve SEO and avoid duplicate content issues.
  
- **Simplified Route Handling**: Eliminates the need to write separate routing logic for paths with and without trailing slashes, as the middleware handles the transformation automatically.

- **Compatibility**: Some clients might automatically add or remove trailing slashes from URLs. This middleware ensures that requests are routed correctly regardless.

- **Redirection Management**: Can be configured to automatically redirect URLs with trailing slashes to their non-slashed counterparts (or vice versa), improving the user experience.

- **Avoiding Route Conflicts**: In many web frameworks, `/path` and `/path/` might be treated as distinct routes. This middleware unifies their handling.
