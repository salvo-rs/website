# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows browsers to send requests to cross-origin servers, overcoming the restrictions imposed by the browser's same-origin policy.

## What is the Same-Origin Policy?

The same-origin policy is a browser security feature that restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. "Same-origin" refers to the same protocol, domain name, and port number.

## Why is CORS Needed?

CORS is needed when a frontend application needs to access APIs from a different origin. For example:
- Frontend application deployed at `https://frontend.com`
- API service deployed at `https://api.backend.com`

Without CORS, the browser would block the frontend application from accessing the API service.

## How CORS Works

CORS implements cross-origin access control through a series of HTTP headers:
- Simple requests: Sent directly, with the server controlling access through response headers
- Preflight requests: The browser first sends an OPTIONS request to ask if cross-origin access is allowed, and only sends the actual request after receiving permission

Since browsers send preflight requests using `Method::OPTIONS`, you need to add handling for these requests by adding the CORS middleware to the `Service`.

## Using CORS in Salvo

Salvo provides built-in CORS middleware that can be easily configured and used. Here's an example:

:::warning
Note that the .hoop(cors) middleware is applied to the `Service`, not to the `Router`. Note that the .hoop(cors) middleware is applied to the `Service`, not to the `Router`. Note that the .hoop(cors) middleware is applied to the `Service`, not to the `Router`.
This automatically handles OPTIONS preflight requests.
```rust
let cors = Cors::new()
    .allow_origin(["http://127.0.0.1:5800", "http://localhost:5800"])
    .allow_methods(vec![Method::GET, Method::POST, Method::DELETE])
    .allow_headers("authorization")
    .into_handler();

// Set up backend router with CORS protection
let router = Router::with_path("hello").post(hello);
let service = Service::new(router).hoop(cors);
```

_**Example Code**_

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'rspress/theme';
import CorsCode from '../../../../codes_md/cors/src/main.mdx';
import CorsCargoCode from '../../../../codes_md/cors/Cargo.mdx';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="main.rs">
    <CorsCode/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Cargo.toml">
    <CorsCargoCode/>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Allowing All Origins

In some development scenarios, you may want to temporarily allow requests from any origin. Salvo supports this through the `AllowOrigin::any()` option.

Before using it, import the AllowOrigin enum:

```rust
use salvo::cors::AllowOrigin;
```

Then configure the CORS middleware like this:

```rust
 let cors = Cors::new()
        .allow_origin(AllowOrigin::any())
        .allow_methods(vec![Method::GET, Method::POST, Method::DELETE])
        .allow_headers("authorization")
        .into_handler();
```

## Main Configuration Options

The CORS middleware provides various configuration options:

- **Allowed origins**: Controls which domains can access resources
- **Allowed methods**: Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed (GET, POST, etc.)
- **Allowed headers**: Specifies which request headers are allowed
- **Exposed headers**: Specifies which response headers can be accessed by the client
- **Allow credentials**: Whether to allow requests to include credential information like cookies
- **Preflight cache duration**: How long preflight request results are cached

By properly configuring CORS, you can ensure both security and meet cross-origin access requirements.
