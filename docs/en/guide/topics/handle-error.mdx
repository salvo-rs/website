# Error Handling

## Common Error Handling Approaches in Rust Applications

Rust's error handling differs from languages like Java—it doesn't have constructs like `try...catch`. The conventional approach is to define a global error handling type at the application level:

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum AppError {
    #[error("io: `{0}`")]
    Io(#[from] io::Error),
    #[error("utf8: `{0}`")]
    FromUtf8(#[from] FromUtf8Error),
    #[error("diesel: `{0}`")]
    Diesel(#[from] diesel::result::Error),
    ...
}

pub type AppResult<T> = Result<T, AppError>;
```

Here, the `thiserror` crate is used, which conveniently helps define custom error types and simplifies code. For brevity, an `AppResult` type is also defined.

### thiserror vs. anyhow

In Rust's error handling ecosystem, two commonly used crates are `thiserror` and `anyhow`:

- **thiserror**: Suitable for library developers to define clear error types. It uses derive macros to help implement the `std::error::Error` trait for custom error types while allowing customization of error display. When building a library or needing to provide users with well-defined error types, `thiserror` is the better choice.

- **anyhow**: Designed for application developers, providing a generic error type `anyhow::Error` that can encapsulate any error implementing the `std::error::Error` trait. It focuses more on error propagation rather than definition, making it ideal for application-layer code. It allows quick conversion of various errors into `anyhow::Error`, reducing boilerplate.

In some scenarios, you might use both crates: `thiserror` for defining error types in libraries and `anyhow` for handling and propagating those errors in applications.

## Error Handling in Handlers

In Salvo, `Handler`s often encounter various errors, such as database connection failures, file access issues, or network errors. For these cases, the aforementioned error handling approach can be applied:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn home() -> AppResult<()> {

}
```

Here, `home` directly returns an `AppResult<()>`. But how should this error be displayed? We need to implement the `Writer` trait for the custom `AppResult` error type, where we can define error presentation:

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for AppError {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        res.render(Text::Plain("I'm a error, hahaha!"));
    }
}
```

In Salvo, a `Handler` can return a `Result` as long as both the `Ok` and `Err` variants implement the `Writer` trait.

### Error Handling with anyhow

Given the widespread use of anyhow, Salvo provides built-in support for `anyhow::Error`. When the `anyhow` feature is enabled, `anyhow::Error` implements the `Writer` trait and is mapped to `InternalServerError`:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "anyhow")]
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for ::anyhow::Error {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        res.render(StatusError::internal_server_error());
    }
}
```

To use the anyhow feature, enable it in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
salvo = { version = "*", features = ["anyhow"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
```

This allows your handler functions to directly return `anyhow::Result<T>`:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn home() -> anyhow::Result<impl Writer> {
    let data = fetch_data().context("Failed to fetch data")?;
    Ok(Text::Plain(data))
}
```

Errors often contain sensitive information that shouldn't be exposed to regular users—doing so would be insecure and a privacy breach. However, developers or administrators might prefer seeing raw error details for debugging.

Since the `write` method provides access to `Request` and `Depot` references, implementing conditional error display becomes straightforward:

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for AppError {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        let user = depot.obtain::<User>();
        if user.is_admin {
            res.render(Text::Plain(e.to_string()));
        } else {
            res.render(Text::Plain("I'm a error, hahaha!"));
        }
    }
}
```

## Displaying Error Pages

Salvo's built-in error pages suffice for most cases, rendering Html, Json, or Xml based on the request's data type. However, there may be scenarios where custom error page displays are desired.

This can be achieved by implementing a custom `Catcher`. For detailed instructions, refer to the [`Catcher`](../concepts/catcher.html) section.
