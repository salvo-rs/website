# Chrono: Rust Date and Time Library

Chrono aims to provide all functionality needed to perform correct date and time operations in the Gregorian calendar:

- The `DateTime` type is timezone-aware by default, with separate timezone-naive types also available.
- Operations that may result in invalid or ambiguous dates and times return `Option` or `MappedLocalTime`.
- Configurable parsing and formatting, with date and time formatting syntax inspired by strftime.
- The `Local` timezone works with the operating system's current timezone.
- Types and operations are implemented with reasonable efficiency in mind.
- To limit binary size, Chrono does not include timezone data by default. Use the companion crates `Chrono-TZ` or `tzfile` for full timezone support.

## Features

Chrono supports various runtime environments and operating systems, with several features that can be enabled or disabled.

### Default Features:

- `alloc`: Enables features that depend on memory allocation (primarily string formatting).
- `std`: Enables features that depend on the standard library. This is a superset of `alloc`, adding interoperability with standard library types and traits.
- `clock`: Enables reading the local timezone (`Local`). This is a superset of `now`.
- `now`: Enables reading the system time (`now`).
- `wasmbind`: Provides an interface to the JS Date API for wasm32 targets.

### Optional Features:

- `serde`: Enables serialization/deserialization via serde.
- `rkyv`: Deprecated; use the `rkyv-*` features instead.
- `rkyv-16`, `rkyv-32`, `rkyv-64`: Enables serialization/deserialization via rkyv, using 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit integers, respectively.
- `rkyv-validation`: Enables rkyv validation support using bytecheck.
- `arbitrary`: Constructs arbitrary instances of types using the Arbitrary crate.
- `unstable-locales`: Enables localization. This adds various methods with the `_localized` suffix.

## Overview

### Time Differences/Durations

Chrono provides the `TimeDelta` type to represent the magnitude of a time span. This is an "exact" duration represented in seconds and nanoseconds, not expressing "nominal" components like days or months.

The `TimeDelta` type was previously named `Duration` (still available as a type alias). A notable difference from the similar `core::time::Duration` is that it is signed rather than unsigned.

### Dates and Times

Chrono provides the `DateTime` type to represent a date and time in a timezone.

`DateTime` is timezone-aware and must be constructed from a `TimeZone` object, which defines how local dates are converted to and from UTC dates. There are three well-known `TimeZone` implementations:

- `Utc` specifies the UTC timezone. It is the most efficient.
- `Local` specifies the system's local timezone.
- `FixedOffset` specifies an arbitrary fixed timezone, such as UTC+09:00 or UTC-10:30.

`DateTime` values with different `TimeZone` types are distinct and cannot be mixed but can be converted between each other using the `DateTime::with_timezone` method.

You can obtain the current date and time in the UTC timezone (`Utc::now()`) or the local timezone (`Local::now()`).

```rust
use chrono::prelude::*;

let utc: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now(); // e.g., `2014-11-28T12:45:59.324310806Z`
let local: DateTime<Local> = Local::now(); // e.g., `2014-11-28T21:45:59.324310806+09:00`
```

Additionally, you can create your own dates and times:

```rust
use chrono::offset::MappedLocalTime;
use chrono::prelude::*;

let dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).unwrap(); // `2014-07-08T09:10:11Z`
```

### Formatting and Parsing

Formatting is done via the `format` method, which uses a format equivalent to the familiar strftime format.

The default `to_string` method and the `{:?}` specifier also provide reasonable representations. Chrono also provides `to_rfc2822` and `to_rfc3339` methods for common formats.

Chrono now also offers date formatting in nearly any language without requiring additional C libraries. This feature is available under the `unstable-locales` feature:

```rust
use chrono::prelude::*;

let dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 11, 28, 12, 0, 9).unwrap();
assert_eq!(dt.format("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S").to_string(), "2014-11-28 12:00:09");
assert_eq!(dt.format_localized("%A %e %B %Y, %T", Locale::fr_BE).to_string(), 
           "vendredi 28 novembre 2014, 12:00:09");
```

Parsing can be done in two ways:

1. The standard `FromStr` trait (and the `parse` method on strings) can be used to parse `DateTime<FixedOffset>`, `DateTime<Utc>`, and `DateTime<Local>` values.
2. `DateTime::parse_from_str` parses a date and time with an offset and returns a `DateTime<FixedOffset>`.

```rust
use chrono::prelude::*;

let dt = "2014-11-28T12:00:09Z".parse::<DateTime<Utc>>().unwrap();
let fixed_dt = DateTime::parse_from_str("2014-11-28 21:00:09 +09:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z").unwrap();
```

### Conversion to/from Epoch Timestamps

Use `DateTime::from_timestamp(seconds, nanoseconds)` to construct a `DateTime<Utc>` from a UNIX timestamp.

Use `DateTime.timestamp` to get the timestamp (in seconds) from a `DateTime`. Additionally, you can use `DateTime.timestamp_subsec_nanos` to get the additional nanoseconds.

```rust
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

// Construct a datetime from the epoch:
let dt: DateTime<Utc> = DateTime::from_timestamp(1_500_000_000, 0).unwrap();
assert_eq!(dt.to_rfc2822(), "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 02:40:00 +0000");

// Get the epoch value from a datetime:
let dt = DateTime::parse_from_rfc2822("Fri, 14 Jul 2017 02:40:00 +0000").unwrap();
assert_eq!(dt.timestamp(), 1_500_000_000);
```

## Limitations

- Only the proleptic Gregorian calendar is supported (i.e., extended to support earlier dates).
- Date types are limited to approximately ±262,000 years from the epoch.
- Time types are limited to nanosecond precision.
- Leap seconds can be represented, but Chrono does not fully support them.
