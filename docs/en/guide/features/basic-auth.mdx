## Introduction to Basic Auth

Basic Auth is a simple HTTP authentication mechanism that transmits username and password by including the `Authorization` field in the HTTP request header. The format is `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>`. Although simple, because the credentials are only Base64 encoded and not encrypted, it typically needs to be used with HTTPS to ensure security.

## Comparison of Basic Auth Implementations in Common Frameworks

| Framework       | Language   | Basic Auth Implementation                                           |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Salvo           | Rust       | Implemented via `BasicAuth` middleware and custom `BasicAuthValidator` |
| Express         | JavaScript | Using the `express-basic-auth` middleware package                 |
| Spring Security | Java       | Implemented via `httpBasic()` configuration and `UserDetailsService` |
| ASP.NET Core    | C#         | Using `.UseAuthentication()` and `AddAuthentication(AuthenticationSchemes.Basic)` |
| Gin             | Go         | Via custom middleware or using the `gin-contrib/auth` package       |

## Use Cases

Basic Auth is suitable for the following scenarios:

1.  **Internal APIs and Tools**: Management tools and APIs used within a company.
2.  **Development and Testing Environments**: Quickly implement authentication without needing a complex login system.
3.  **Simple API Protection**: When a complex user management system is not required.
4.  **In Conjunction with Other Security Measures**: As part of a multi-layered security architecture.

In Salvo, the Basic Auth middleware can be easily integrated into routes. Custom validation logic can be implemented by implementing the `BasicAuthValidator` trait, offering great flexibility.

## Important Considerations

- Always use with HTTPS to protect credential transmission.
- Not suitable for production environments handling sensitive information.
- Consider using more secure authentication methods like JWT, OAuth, etc., for production environments.
