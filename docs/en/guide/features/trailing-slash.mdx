# Trailing Slash

A middleware for automatically adding or removing trailing `/`.

## Use Cases

The Trailing Slash middleware is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **URL Normalization**: Ensures all URLs follow a consistent format (by uniformly adding or removing trailing slashes), which helps improve SEO and avoid duplicate content issues.
  
- **Simplified Route Handling**: Eliminates the need to write separate routing logic for URLs with and without trailing slashes, as the middleware automatically handles this conversion.

- **Compatibility**: Some clients may automatically add or remove trailing slashes from URLs. This middleware ensures that requests are correctly routed.

- **Redirect Management**: Can be configured to automatically redirect URLs with trailing slashes to those without (or vice versa), enhancing the user experience.

- **Avoiding Route Conflicts**: In many web frameworks, `/path` and `/path/` may be treated as different routes. This middleware can handle them uniformly.
