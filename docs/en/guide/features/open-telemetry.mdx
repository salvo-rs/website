# OpenTelemetry Integration  

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides standardized methods for collecting and exporting telemetry data (including traces, metrics, and logs) from applications. It helps developers monitor application performance, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of distributed systems.  

Key Advantages of OpenTelemetry:  
- Unified API and tools with no vendor lock-in  
- Support for multiple programming languages and backend systems  
- Low-overhead data collection  
- Robust support for distributed tracing  

A middleware that provides OpenTelemetry support is available. For reference, see the [example](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/tree/main/examples/otel-jaeger) in the official repository.
