# HTTP/3 Support

Salvo provides support for HTTP/3, which can be enabled via the `quinn` feature. HTTP/3 is based on the QUIC protocol and offers lower latency and better performance compared to traditional HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, especially in unstable network environments.

## Enabling HTTP/3 Support

To enable HTTP/3 support in Salvo, you need to activate the `quinn` feature in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["quinn"] }
```

## HTTP/3 Use Cases

HTTP/3 is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

- Applications on mobile devices and in unstable network environments
- Real-time applications requiring low latency
- Scenarios involving parallel downloads of many small files
- Applications needing connection migration (e.g., switching from WiFi to cellular without interrupting the connection)

## Example Code

The following is a simple HTTP/3 server example that supports both HTTP/3 (QUIC) and HTTPS (TCP) simultaneously:

```rust
use salvo::conn::rustls::{Keycert, RustlsConfig};
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler function that responds with "Hello World"
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize the logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Load TLS certificate and private key from embedded PEM files
    let cert = include_bytes!("../certs/cert.pem").to_vec();
    let key = include_bytes!("../certs/key.pem").to_vec();

    // Create a router and add an endpoint
    let router = Router::new().get(hello);

    // Configure TLS settings using Rustls
    let config = RustlsConfig::new(Keycert::new().cert(cert.as_slice()).key(key.as_slice()));

    // Create a TCP listener with TLS encryption, listening on port 5800
    let listener = TcpListener::new(("0.0.0.0", 5800)).rustls(config.clone());

    // Create a QUIC listener and combine it with the TCP listener
    let acceptor = QuinnListener::new(config.build_quinn_config().unwrap(), ("0.0.0.0", 5800))
        .join(listener)
        .bind()
        .await;

    // Start the server supporting both HTTP/3 (QUIC) and HTTPS (TCP)
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}
```

## Key Code Analysis

### TLS Configuration

```rust
// Configure TLS settings using Rustls
let config = RustlsConfig::new(Keycert::new().cert(cert.as_slice()).key(key.as_slice()));
```

Since HTTP/3 is based on the QUIC protocol, and QUIC requires encryption using TLS 1.3, it's necessary to configure TLS certificates and keys. In Salvo, we use `RustlsConfig` to configure TLS.

### Combining Listeners

```rust
// Create a TCP listener with TLS encryption
let listener = TcpListener::new(("0.0.0.0", 5800)).rustls(config.clone());

// Create a QUIC listener and combine it with the TCP listener
let acceptor = QuinnListener::new(config.build_quinn_config().unwrap(), ("0.0.0.0", 5800))
    .join(listener)
    .bind()
    .await;
```

This code is the core part of handling HTTP/3 in Salvo. It first creates a TLS-enabled TCP listener (for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2), then creates a QUIC listener (for HTTP/3). By using the `join` method, these two listeners are combined, allowing the server to handle requests from different protocols simultaneously.

## Running the Example

To run this example, you need available TLS certificates and private keys. In a development environment, you can use self-signed certificates. The complete example code can be found in the [Salvo GitHub repository](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/tree/main/examples/hello-h3).

It's important to note that many clients do not yet fully support HTTP/3, so it is essential for this server to support both HTTP/3 and HTTPS simultaneously.

## Important Notes

1. HTTP/3 requires TLS 1.3 support, so valid certificates and keys must be configured.
2. Clients need to support the HTTP/3 protocol to utilize this feature; otherwise, they will fall back to HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
3. In a production environment, you should use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), not self-signed certificates.
